# datalang

The goal of datalang is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of datalang from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("datalang")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgararuiz/datalang")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(datalang)

t <- translate_data(ggplot2::diamonds, system.file("specs/diamonds-es.yml", package = "datalang")) 

head(t)
```

```{r}
create_rd(ggplot2::diamonds, system.file("specs/diamonds-es.yml", package = "datalang")) 
```
 

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars, include = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, include = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
