The goal is to help people whose first, or preferred, language is not English.  This package aids in translating the data and help files.  The hope is to lower the barrier of learning R, and also data analysis.

Even though this package can translate data on the fly, this package is meant to be used inside another R package.

## Installation

The development version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgararuiz/datalang")
```

## How it works

The `datalang` package uses a translation spec file for translation.  The expected file format is YAML. `datalang` uses the YAML file to know which column names, and data values, to change.  The same YAML spec file can contain the information needed to produce a help file.

Here is a sample spec file:

```yaml
df:
  source: thisweek
  name: esta_semana
variables:
  day:
    trans: dia
    desc: Dia de la semana
    values:
      friday: viernes
      saturday: sábado
      sunday: domingo
  morning:
    trans: maniana
    desc: Temperatura a las 10 AM
  afternoon:
    trans: tarde
    desc: Temperatura a las 3 PM
help:
  name: esta_semana
  alias: esta_semana
  title: Un data set de ejemplo
  description: Tres días de temperaturas tomadas en la mañana y la tarde
```

So a the data set can go from this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
datalang::thisweek
```

To this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
esta_semana
```

## Basics

The `datalang` package includes a simple data set called: `thisweek`.  The package also has a YAML spec file with the translation. 

```{r}
my_spec <- system.file("specs/thisweek.yml", package = "datalang")
```

The `translate_data()` function can ready the YAML spec file found in the `my_spec` file path. It uses that spec to locate the data set, in this case `thisweek`, modifies a copy of the data set based on the spec, and outputs a new, translated, data set. 

```{r}
translate_data(my_spec)
```

Not all of the spec's entries were needed to translate the data.  The other entries are useful for creating the help documentation.  In `datalang` there are two functions that output the help:

1. `create_rd()` - It outputs a character vector with contents that can be saved as an rd file.
1. `create_html_help()` - It outputs a character vector with contents that can be saved as an HTML file.


## Using

There are two options to use `datalang` to provide accessibility to your package and data:

1. Use in a new R package dedicated to a translation to a single language
1. Use to extend, and provide translations from inside an existing R package

### Option 1 - New package dedicated to a single translation

A package can be built to focus on translations to a single language.  Here are some of the features of this approach:

  1. The package contains copies of the data sets in the target language
  1. The created help files are R "friendly"

The `translate_folder()` function is a higher level wrapper function that produces the translations and help files.  The procedure would be to run `translate_folder()` on the package's project folder, and then rebuilt the package.  The default arguments have the current expectations:

- The translation spec YAML files will be located in the R project's `inst/specs` folder.
- The target folder to save the new data sets to will be `data`.
- The location of the new help files will be `man`.

For a working example of this approach, check out the `datos` package.  This package is dedicated to translating data sets into Spanish: https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos.

### Option 2 - Provide translations as part of your existing package

The goal of this approach will be for the existing package to provide the translated data, and the help files, without becoming bulky with copies of the data.  For this approach, `datalang` provides a function, called `on_attach`, that can be run when the package is attached to the R session.  

When the package is loaded, via `library()`, then `datalang` can check for a language setting, and then use that setting as both a trigger, and the pointer to which language should `datalang` translate to.  At that point, the translated data set is created and loaded into the R session.

The `on_attach()` function can be added to the package's `.onAttach()` function, so it's processed when the library is loaded.  This is what is currently on a fork of `gapminder`:

```
.onAttach <- function(...) {
  datalang::on_attach("gapminder")
}
```

Using this fork as an example. The language is set to Spanish by using the LANGUAGE environment variable (`Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "es")`):

```
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "es")

library(gapminder)

#> El lenguaje asignado actualmente es español  
#>   Cargando datos y/o ayuda de los siguientes objetos : 
#>      gapminder  >->  paises 
#>    Una nueva función de ayuda fue cargada: ayuda() 
#>      Utilice asi: ayuda(paises)
```

#### Help function

Because the help documentation is created on-the-fly, it cannot be added to the regular data file that functions such as `help()` use.  So a new help wrapper function is created that creates an HTML version of the data set, or function, help.  If the function, data set, or general topic is not one created by `datalang` then the requested topic is passed through to the `help()` function in the background.  

The help's function name will be set based on the language.  So in Spanish, the name will be: `ayuda`.
