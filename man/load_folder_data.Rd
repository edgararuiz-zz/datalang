\description{
Cycles through all of the spec files inside a folder specified in the 'spec_folder' argument.
The function translates and loads each new data set to a specified R environment.

This function is meant for packages that will do not wish to ship a copy of the data set, and
wish to execute the translation on the fly, preferably when the "host" package is attached.
