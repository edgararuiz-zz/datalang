\description{
Cycles through all of the spec files inside a folder.  The default behaivor is if a language
setting is detected ('Sys.getenv("LANGUAGE")'), it will look for a sub-folder that matches the
setting inside the 'spec_folder' path.

The function translates and loads each new data set to a specified R environment.

This function is meant for packages that will do not wish to ship a copy of the data set, and
wish to execute the translation on the fly, preferably when the "host" package is attached.
